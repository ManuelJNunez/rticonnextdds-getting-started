# Introduction to Content-Filtered Topics (C#)


**Note**: These examples are configured to build a *.NET 5* application, but
the library is compatible with any *.NET Standard 2.0*-compatible runtime.

If you want to use *.NET Core 3.x*, simply edit the `.csproj` files and change:
```xml
<TargetFramework>net5</TargetFramework>
```

To:
```xml
<TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework>
```
